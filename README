I. References to the papers:

The above talk about the constitutive model

2) https://www.math.ucla.edu/~jteran/papers/TSNF03.pdf

This discusses how to robustly handle inverting elements

II. The code :

All the simulation is written as the functions of SimMesh class, found in the mesh.hpp & mesh.cpp files. The code for handling inversion is in the CalculateStresses() function
